Please create a simple CSS file for my portfolio website inspired by a Rapunzel from Tangled look and feel: 
    - Navigation bar Header/intro section 
    - About me section 
    - Education section 
    - Projects section 
    - Contact info
I'd like my website to have the colors, style, and mood that remind people of Tangled. Make sure the layout is responsive for mobile and desktop screens. Please add helpful comments that explain what different parts of the CSS do. Some specific things I'd like: 
    - A color scheme based on Rapunzel (especially the soft purple)
    - Easy-to-read fonts 
    - Some simple hover effects on buttons and links 
    - Basic responsive design (works on mobile and desktop) 
    - Reasonable spacing between elements
    - Fancy animations
