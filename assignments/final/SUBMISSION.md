## Reflection
Our group decided to create a movie review app, and After The Credits came to life. We started with the backend, then the frontend, and finally connected the two, adjusting as we went. I was responsible for data and coordination. We worked on creating schema for the different content we needed. I also contributed to building seeder scripts. Later on, I leveraged the TMDB api so we would be able to pull titles from their database in a way that matched our schema. This project was a significant learning experience for me, especially since I had never used Express.js, Node.js, or MongoDB before. What stuck the most was using the terminal to read logs, troubleshoot, and run the program.
